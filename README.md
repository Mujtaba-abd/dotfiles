## desclamer 

the setup script only works for fedora you will have to change dnf to you packege manager(in line 12 and 3) and remove line 4 

you should run pywal for the first time so it will crate some needed files

`wal -i ~/path/to-you-wallpaper`

## installion 

`git clone https://github.com/Mujtaba-abd/dotfiles`

clone it in  your home dir

`cd dotfiles`
